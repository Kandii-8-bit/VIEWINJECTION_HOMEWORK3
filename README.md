# VIEWINJECTION_HOMEWORK3

## This is my Homework Three, View Injection.

This is for the class N315 and I am going to upload this. Setup similar to the VIEW_INJECTION assignment we did. The only page not styled is the index, I was scared it might mess with my nav, app, and footer injections. All other pages injected are styled! I had issues getting paragraphs exactly where I wanted them on the blog page. For contact page I could not find a nice map photo that didn't really look tacky on the internet. Brush PNG in footer is from https://www.flaticon.com/authors/nhor-pha
